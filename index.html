                <p>“I believe there are far more possibilities than happily ever after or tragedy. Every story has the potential for infinite endings.”
                    <span>― Stephanie Garber, Once Upon a Broken Heart</span>

                    “Every person has the power to change their fate if they are brave enough to fight for what they desire more than anything.”

                    “Every good story needs a villain.
                    But the best villains are the ones you secretly like.”

                    “Every story has four parts - the beginning, the middle, the almost ending, and the true ending.”

                <p>
                    “Happy endings can be caught, but they are difficult to hold on to. They are dreams that want to escape the night. They are treasure with wings. They are wild, feral, reckless things that need to be constantly chased, or they will certainly run away.”
                    <span>― Stephanie Garber, The Ballad of Never After</span>

                    “Not everyone gets a true ending. There are two types of endings because most people give up at the part of the story where things are the worst, where the situation feels hopeless. But that’s when hope is needed most. only those who persevere can find their true ending.”
