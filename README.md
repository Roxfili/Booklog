A custom HTML dashboard designed to bridge the gap between social media discovery and actual reading. BookLog provides a dedicated space to organize and track those 'TBR' book recommendation videos that often get lost in social media folders, transforming saved links into a curated personal library.

## The Problem
We all have that social media folder (TikTok, Instagram, YouTube) overflowing with "BookTok" recommendations that eventually fade into oblivion. **BookLog** is my easy manual solution to finally give those links a home, transforming saved videos into an organized TBR (To Be Read) list or concrete reviews.

## Features
* **TBR Management:** A dedicated space to paste those bookish links that would otherwise get lost in your "saved" folders.
* **Podium View:** A special showcase for the "Top 3" books of the year with a custom-built podium.
* **Year review** A sum up of your reading year, showing also your favourite book for each month.

## Tech Stack
* **HTML5 / CSS3:** Leveraging Flexbox and Absolute Positioning for a precise layout.
* **FontAwesome:** For social media icons and the rating system.
* **Google Fonts:** Using editorial fonts (like Baskerville/Georgia) for a classic, sharp "bookish" look.

## How to use it
1.  **Clone** the repo: `git clone https://github.com/Roxfili/booklog.git`
2.  Open `index.html` in your favorite browser.
3.  **Manually add** your books and the links to those videos you saved "for later."
